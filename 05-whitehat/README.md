# Whitehat - Tier 2
You stumbled across an old [bug bounty report](https://medium.com/immunefi/polygon-lack-of-balance-check-bugfix-postmortem-2-2m-bounty-64ec66c24c7d) from the end of 2021 related to the Polygon codebase. Understanding that other blockchains are using this code, you decide to double-check that the largest ones are not susceptible to vulnerabilities disclosed in this report.


- a) Find at least two Polygon forks that could potentially be vulnerable.
- b) Provide the code to check if these blockchains are safe.
- c) Estimate the potential maximum loss if this attack is possible on both blockchains.
