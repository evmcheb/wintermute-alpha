# Long-Tail-Enjoyor - Tier 3
Youâ€™re an active member of the Synthetix community and noticed that the implementation of one of [their latest SIPs](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-112/) will be deployed today (May 13, 2021).

- a) How, in theory, can you make money based on the SIP specification?

The EtherWrapper contract is a fixed-rate exchange between ETH and sETH with a percentage fee and a max swap amount set by governance. 
We can make money by arbitraging with other dexes on chain that aren't fixed-rate.
Curve has majority of the sETH liquidity in the ETH/sETH pool. When large swaps depeg the pool we can arbitrage with the EtherWrapper contract in the opposite direction. We can also arbitrage the pool when Spartan governance updates the parameters - namely maxETH() which controls the buffering capacity of the contract, and mintFeeRate()/burnFeeRate() which control the mint and burn fees.
If the mint and burn fees are changed to be below the spread between the two pools, we can arbitrage them. 

I wanted to double check that this was the only way to make money from this contract. 
I dumped all the transactions involving a mint or burn transaction from the EtherWrapper contract.

Then calculated the value of the contract before and after the transaction. Looking at the transactions, the biggest gains are when Synthetix governance updates the parameters.

The data is in opportunities.txt

I excluded transactions to the 1inch contracts as they are usually just user swaps.

The most profitable opportunities occur when governance updates the maxETH(), mintFeeRate() or burnFeeRate() parameters.
We can backrun this transaction if the curve pool is off peg by more than the mint-burn fee. 

- b) Provide the simulation data when you execute the opportunity using the full maxETH amount.

The largest opportunity I could find was the transaction below. 

Block 12473576  To: 0xd96ad870ef5E36DA657641a645Abcb89EC17A598  Amount: 15000.000 ETH   Extracted: 18.928 ETH   Hash: 0xb355c2947ba5f4758b0a2c74e5a607215b0c681c7230dccffea780edfdeeaf10

This was a particularly profitable opportunity, making 19 eth = $52k at the time.
This came after synthetix dao updated the mintBurnRate from 1% to 0.5% in this transaction

We can estimate the price of the curve pool at the block before the mint.

100852678 [1.008e8]

With a 2bps curve fee, the exchange rate is approximately 1.00852678 * (1+2/10000)=1:1.0087284854. 
Which explains why there was a no-arbitrage condition before the parameter update as the fee was 1% and the exchange rate was 1:1.00852678.
Since the mint fee is being changed to 0.5%, there is a ~0.35% arbitrage opportunity.
